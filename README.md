# ModernPDFViewer

![A screenshot of ModernPDFViewer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rhysforyou/ModernPDFViewer/master/Screenshot.png)

This sample builds on [work done by frameworker](https://frameworker.wordpress.com/2018/07/27/pdfkit-the-lost-samples/) to update Apple's PDFKit samples for macOS High Sierra. I wanted to take his example and rewrite it in a slightly more modern style of Objective-C as a learning exercise for myself.

Purpose:

Demonstrates some simple and some less than simple uses of PDFKit including:

- Basic use of PDFView
- Using PDFDocument to search
- PDFOutline as data for NSOutlineView.
